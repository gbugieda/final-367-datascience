**Title:** Impact of Oil Spills on Marine and Coastal Ecosystems: Deepwater Horizon Incident
   
**Problem:**:
   * Investigating the impact of the 2010 Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill on the marine and coastal life in the Gulf of Mexico region over the years.

**Background:**

Oil spills and pollution in the ocean can have devastating effects on marine life and coastal ecosystems, and they happen to be a consequence of oil dependency and depletion of oil reserves.  Offshore drilling using deep water rigs is one way to extract the resource.  However, drilling for oil in the ocean comes with some detriments, one of them being that oil can leak into the ocean during instrument malfunction or rig explosion.  When oil spills into the sea, it "initially spreads over the water surface as a slick a few millimeters thick" [1].  Rough sea conditions and waves can make the oil slick worse, and if there is a lot of oil or minimal dispersion, damage to wildlife can occur [1]. 
    
One of the most devastating and infamous oil spills in recent history was the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  On April 20, 2010, there was an explosion and gas blowout on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that resulted in an oil leak that continued polluting the water for 87 days until the well was capped [2].  All in all, over "3.19 million barrels of oil were released into the ocean during the spill, in addition to several hundred thousand tons of hydrocarbon gases" [2].  Ocean currents carried oil away from the site of the explosion towards the coasts and beaches, and large cleanup operations were implemented to contain and remove the oil as well as to help the marine ecosystems recover.

**Research Questions:**
   1. What are the effects of oil spills on birds?
       * How much more severe are effects on birds closer to where oil spill originated vs farther away?
   2. How do oil spills impact local fishing and coastal economies?
   3. What is the effect of oil on fish?
   
   
**Justification:**
   * Question 1:
       * According to researchers studying bird mortality from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, "following large oil spills at sea, seabirds are particularly sensitive to both internal and external oil exposure," and their habits "lead to frequent contact with surface oil[3]".  After studying the mortality rates of birds, they found that between "36,000 and 67,000 birds died in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico" due to the Deepwater oil spill[3].  While this is a very large number of seabird deaths, it brings to light the question of how many birds were affected by the oil spill and managed to survive, and what exactly happened to them in terms of oil exposure.  Oil spills can threaten birds in non-lethal ways, with "external contamination of feathers considered the single most harmful effect of oil on birds" because it can lead to loss of water repellency, insulation, and flight functions in feathers [4].  Therefore, it is not only important to study these effects on seabirds after oil spills, but it is also important to look at how far away from the original spill location birds experienced these effects in order to help with recovery efforts.
   * Question 2:
       * While most oil spills directly affect marine life on the surface and shore, due to the circumstances of the Deepwater Horizon spill, and the depth at which it occurred, marine life in deeper parts of the ocean were likely impacted as well[5].  This extensive damage to organisms in all parts of the ocean is especially detrimental to commercial and recreational fishing, as losses would be in the billions[5]. "Impacts on marine ecosystems translate into impacts and the economy and livelihoods, including commercial fisheries, recreations, mariculture, tourism, and energy markets.[5]"  For example, food safety concerns are often raised regarding fish caught in oil-contaminated areas and neighboring locations, leading to a decrease in the ability to sell fish at previous rates [5].  "Immediately following the DH spill, the region's key shrimp and oyster fishing areas were officially closed," which was especially significant because "about 70% of the commerically caught shrimp and oysters in the US come from the GOM" (Gulf of Mexico) [5].  Therefore, oil spills and their lasting effects can harm fishing industries and economies that rely on seafood as their major export.  It is important to look at how these effects can hurt these industries, as well as the resilience of these economies and communities as they attempt to bounce back from near collapse.   
   * Question 3:
       * There have been several studies on the effects of oil on fish species, and some of the notable effects include "premature hatching, reduced growth rates, genetic abnormalities, increased mortality" as well as increased disease rates [5].  Oil can also make its way up with food chain, as the oil and hydrocarbons absorbed by plankton, mussels, and other benthic organisms can contaminate larger fish and predatory species that eat these animals for food [5].  When investigating the impact of oil on fish, evidence from previous oil spills is important to consider.  Studies on salmon population after fish eggs were exposed to the Exxon Oil Spill demonstrated that there was a reduction in the overall production of adult fish, and even low levels of oil poisoning were dangerous because of the delayed reproductive effects [6].  Therefore, it is important to look at how oil affects fish, specifically in relation to the Deepwater Horizon event to see if any connections can be made between past oil spills or if any new knowledge can be obtained about the resiliency or mortality of fish species affected by oil.

       * This dataset includes information about the mercury content and trophic structure of deep/coastal fish to determine if oil spills lead to an increase in MeHg production and MeHg contaminants in fish.  The data was collected from 2011-2014 in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon spill.
   

**Ethical Concerns:**
   * Stakeholder: Offshore drilling companies
       * Ramifications: Data released about the effects of oil spills on marine life and ecosystems could lead to company profit loss if their companies are no longer utilized for drilling because of fears over more oil spills.  There could also be increased negative public opinion of these companies with the publicity of oil-related animal deaths.
   * Stakeholder: Tourism Businesses
       * Ramifications: Data released about places still recovering from oil spills could deter tourists from using beaches or swimming on shorelines that are still affected by residual oil or oil damages.  This could lead to a decrease in profits for coastal communities that rely on tourism to survive.
   * Stakeholder: Fishing Industry
       * Ramifications:  Fishing industries along coastal communities affected by oil spills could be hurt by inability to catch/sell fish (because of increase in dead fish due to the oil) as well as public distrust of buying seafood from area inundated with crude oil.
